## üîß Troubleshooting

### For Standalone Executable:
1. **"Windows protected your PC" message**
   - Click "More info"
   - Click "Run anyway"
   - This appears because the executable is not signed with a certificate

2. **Game won't start**
   - Make sure you extracted all files from the ZIP
   - Try running as administrator
   - Check your antivirus isn't blocking it

3. **No sound**
   - Check if your system volume is on
   - Make sure no other programs are using your sound device
   - Try restarting the game

### For Python Version:
1. **"Python not found" error**
   - Make sure Python is installed and added to PATH
   - Try using `python3` instead of `python`

2. **"Module not found" error**
   - Make sure you're in the virtual environment (you should see `(venv)` in your prompt)
   - Try running `pip install -r requirements.txt` again

3. **Game running slowly**
   - Close other running applications
   - Make sure your graphics drivers are up to date
   - Check if your computer meets the minimum requirements
